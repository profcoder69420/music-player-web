          If you don't wanna see me<br /><br />
          Did a full 180, crazy<br /><br />
          Thinking 'bout the way I was<br /><br />
          Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe<br /><br />
          But look at where I ended up<br /><br />
          I'm all good already<br /><br />
          So moved on, it's scary<br /><br />
          I'm not where you left me at all, so<br /><br />
          If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody<br /><br />
          If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br /><br />
          Don't show up, don't come out<br /><br />
          Don't start caring about me now<br /><br />
          Walk away, you know how<br /><br />
          Don't start caring about me now<br /><br />
          Aren't you the guy who tried to<br /><br />
          Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?<br /><br />
          Though it took some time to survive you<br /><br />
          I'm better on the other side<br /><br />
          I'm all good already<br /><br />
          So moved on, it's scary<br /><br />
          I'm not where you left me at all, so<br /><br />
          If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody<br /><br />
          If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br /><br />
          Don't show up, don't come out<br /><br />
          Don't start caring about me now<br /><br />
          Walk away, you know how<br /><br />
          Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)<br /><br />
          Oh, oh<br /><br />
          Don't come out, out, out<br /><br />
          Don't show up, up, up<br /><br />
          Don't start now (oh)<br /><br />
          Oh, oh<br /><br />
          Don't come out, out<br /><br />
          I'm not where you left me at all, so<br /><br />

          Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)<br /><br />
          Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)<br /><br />
          Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)<br /><br />
          Don't start caring about me now (so)<br /><br />
          Oh, oh<br /><br />
          Don't come out, out, out<br /><br />
          Don't show up, up, up<br /><br />
          Walk away, walk away (so)<br /><br />
